Fill in all the words to complete the crossword!  Every non-shaded square is part of at least one word, though some land at the crossroads of two.

## Notes on Usage
Yellow square = cursor (current square)

Blue squares = possible word space

Click on the square you want your cursor to go to, or use the _arrow keys_ to navigate around.

Type to fill in the squares, and use _Backspace_ to delete characters.

_If you type, cursor will automatically move to the next square in the blue block_

Click a square to change its typing orientation (eg. horizontal to vertical).

The words you have used are crossed out in the word list on the right.  When there are only five more words left to go, you get a special highlight effect.

If you win or run out of time, you will have the option to restart the game or try another (random) crossword.

## Tools
**Colorize:** Colorize all squares that are supposed to hold the same character _(Note: May conflict with the words you have entered if they do not correspond with the answer)_

**Timer:** Click to start and pause timer _(Note: Configure timer duration in 'Settings')_

**Settings:** Opens settings for game mode / timer length / restart options.

**Easy Length Search:** Click on the headings in the word list to highlight all available space in the crossword that form blocks of the corresponding length. _(See Below)_
